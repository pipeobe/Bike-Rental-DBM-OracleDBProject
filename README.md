# Bike-Rental-DBM-Project

The purpose of this project was to build a database on an Oracle DB account to demonstrate how SQL can be used to work with data and enhance business operations.


The hypothetical scenario centers on enhancing the information systems for a bike rental business that received funds from an investor to expand across North America and Canada. For their sole operating site, this company had previously kept all of its business and client-related information locally (using an excel sheet, for example) and as a backup on a hard drive. It would now be moved to a cloud server so that it could be accessed from many locations. This not only makes the database more secure but also safeguards the business and its clients. – but also gives it a more ideal database infrastructure to make the company’s data more efficient and accessible.
